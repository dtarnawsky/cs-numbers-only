# Number only input
This example uses a directive to filter the input of an `ion-input` component to just numbers.

## Usage
Here's an example of the directives use:
`<ion-input [(ngModel)]="ionInputValue" inputmode="numeric" appNumbersOnly></ion-input>`

You can copy `numbers-only.directive.ts` into your own project.
